            <p>There are some things in life that are out of your control that you can't change and you've got to
                live
                with. The choice that we have, though, is either to give up or keep on going. I tell your life is
                interesting, Life is a JOURNEY. But I tell you there are sometimes in life where you fall down and
                you
                feel you don't have the strength to get back up. You see, if you try 100 times to get back up and if
                you
                fail 100 times, if you FAIL and you'll going to GIVE UP
